# What is a vector database?

A vector database is a type of database that is designed to store and manage high-dimensional data, such as vectors. 

Vectors are mathematical representations of data points in a multi-dimensional space, and they are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. Vector databases are optimized for storing and querying large volumes of vector data efficiently, allowing for fast retrieval and analysis of the data. They often use specialized indexing techniques to enable efficient similarity search and nearest neighbor search, which are common operations in vector databases.
