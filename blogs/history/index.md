# Overview

This section is the story behind PiramidDB: how the idea started, why I decided to build it, and what pushed me to keep going even when it got hard.

I’ll talk about my background, the pain points I kept running into with existing tools, and how those frustrations slowly turned into a project. It’s less of a polished “startup origin story” and more of a real build log from someone figuring things out in public.
