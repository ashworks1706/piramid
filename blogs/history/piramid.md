# The Evolution

I called it piramid. made specifically for rag applications and fast latency large scale environments where demand is dynamic. 

> Piramid is a latency-first vector database written in Rust. The goal is to keep the database and your LLM on the same device, minimize round-trips, and expose a simple HTTP API.

It started as a simple idea in my head, but i knew it is very complex and difficult, but i had this excitement and a good feeling about it, that i'm working on something that's outisde my skillset and i will become a better version of myself after this. 

I got to excalidraw, jotted down the architecture, the components, the flow, the data management, the storage management, the indexing strategies, the search algorithms, the API design, the CLI design, the caching strategies, the collection management, the sharding strategies, the replication strategies, the consistency models, the durability models, the backup and restore strategies, the monitoring and logging strategies, the security strategies, the deployment strategies, the scaling strategies, and everything in between. 

I just noticed at every point how deep these things were and how cohesively they run together. 

> Even though piramid, is super early stage and single node based, i actually want to put the things i read from [that book]() into practice.

#### The Journey

Further in the blogs i will talk about these exact components and how they work. I do not want them to be just technical explanations, i want to talk about the why and how i came up with these ideas, the challenges i faced, the tradeoffs i had to make, the alternatives i considered and the future possibilities. Keep in mind this is just an education project i've built, i dont want them to be judged or questioned as if this was a startup. this is a project that i built for learning and sharing my knowledge, so i will not talk about the market side of things, the competition side of things, the funding side of things,  and everything in between.
