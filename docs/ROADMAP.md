# Piramid Development Roadmap

**Current Status:** Phase 5 Complete ✅  
**Next Priority:** Phase 9 → 9.5 → 10 → 10.5 (Path to Production)

## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

**Track 1: Production-Ready Core** (Phases 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5)
- These phases are **critical** for production deployment
- Must be completed before Phases 6-8 for stability
- Focus: Performance, reliability, security

**Track 2: Feature Expansion** (Phases 6, 7, 8)
- Build on top of production-ready foundation
- Can be implemented in parallel after Track 1 is stable

**Track 3: Advanced/Experimental** (Phases 11-18)
- Cutting-edge features and optimizations
- Differentiation from competitors (GPU, WASM, Agent Memory)

> **Note:** See main README.md for detailed phase breakdowns. This file will be expanded as phases are completed.

## Production Readiness

### Required for v1.0
- Phase 9: Performance & Indexing (HNSW, SIMD, mmap)
- Phase 9.5: Data Durability (WAL, ACID, backups)
- Phase 10: Production Features (observability, validation)
- Phase 10.5: Security (auth, RBAC, rate limiting)

### After v1.0
- Phases 6-8: Feature expansion
- Phases 11-18: Advanced features
