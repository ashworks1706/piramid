## Notes

- Wait until Phase 9-10.5 are complete before writing production docs
- API docs should be finalized when API is stable
- Performance docs need real benchmarks from HNSW implementation
- Security docs depend on Phase 10.5 auth implementation

**Priority:** Focus on code first, documentation follows.
